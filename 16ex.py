# if you don't have that file, it creates it (w does it, as per doc)
# 'w' tells open that I want to write on the file (can also be r (read) or a (append, i.e., add to something))
## that's why I didn't need 'r' on exercise 15
# SD 5: if you have 'w', no need to add the truncate later, w already does that (i.e., W gets rid of what's in there, A adds)
# using w+, r+ or a+ let's me do both read and write, not just one or the other

# SD 2: read the file you just created
# print(target.read()) doesn't work, why? Error I get is "unsupported operation: not readable"
## maybe because W tells python that I can only write, not read (target is not only open(filename), but also modifier). let's try with W+
### nope... actually, it worked! but it seems to be reading the '\n', because it prints a blank line
## p. 32 mentions a "seek" command, which implies I can r/w/a different lines of the file; let's try to use this
target.seek(0)
print(target.read()) # IT WORKED! But is there a way I can do both ln 44 and 45 in only one?

print('And finally, we close it.')
target.close()
