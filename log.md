**Day 6: December 25, 2018, Tuesday**

**Progress**: Around 4h total, from beginning to map the game and then coding it - most of that working on the defensive matchup function and how to create a complete list.

**Thoughts**: Challenging, Stack Overflow is your bible from now own. Already found what to work on tomorrow, including reading about dicts and tuples.

**Project**: <a href=https://github.com/semosso/lpthw/blob/master/nbagame7.py>NBA Game 7</a>
